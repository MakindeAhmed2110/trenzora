## Telegram Trading Bot: Codebase Breakdown & Zora Token Trading

### **Overview**
The Telegram Trading Bot is a TypeScript-based backend that allows users to trade Zora tokens directly from Telegram. It is designed for the Zora Coinathon Hackathon to showcase seamless, secure, and user-friendly DeFi trading on Base.

### **Codebase Structure**
- **Entry Point:** `telegram-trading-bot/index.ts` initializes the bot, loads environment variables, and sets up command handlers.
- **Commands:** All user interactions (buy, sell, balance, deposit, withdraw, trending, etc.) are handled in `src/commands/`.
- **Core Logic:**
  - `src/lib/swap.ts`: Handles swaps, price quotes, and gas estimation using OpenOcean and Sentio APIs.
  - `src/lib/database.ts`: Manages user wallets, balances, and transaction history (SQLite).
  - `src/lib/history.ts`: Fetches and tracks token balances and historical data.
  - `src/lib/encryption.ts`: Encrypts/decrypts private keys for secure storage.
- **Types:** All data structures and command types are defined in `src/types/`.
- **Utils:** Helper functions for formatting, validation, and keyboard UI in `src/utils/`.

### **How It Trades Zora Tokens**
1. **Wallet Management:**
   - Users can create or import a wallet directly in Telegram. Private keys are encrypted and stored securely.
2. **Token Discovery:**
   - The bot fetches trending Zora tokens using the `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` and presents them to the user.
3. **Buy/Sell Flow:**
   - User selects a token and enters the amount to buy/sell.
   - The bot fetches a live price quote and gas estimate using OpenOcean and Sentio APIs.
   - The user confirms the trade; the bot signs and sends the transaction on Base Mainnet.
   - MEV protection is applied for optimal execution.
4. **Transaction Feedback:**
   - The bot provides real-time status updates, transaction hashes, and error handling.
5. **History & Alerts:**
   - Users can view their balance and trade history for both ETH and Zora tokens.
   - The bot can send alerts for price changes, new trends, or completed trades.

### **Why This Matters for Zora Coinathon**
- **Onboarding:** Lowers the barrier for new users to trade Zora tokens‚Äîno dApp or browser wallet required.
- **Speed:** Enables instant trading and trend reaction from any device via Telegram.
- **Security:** Private keys are encrypted; MEV protection ensures fair execution.
- **Innovation:** Demonstrates how Zora‚Äôs ecosystem can be integrated into mainstream messaging apps for mass adoption.

---

### 3. **Alerts Agent**
- Scans Zora trending coins automatically and on-demand.
- Sends detailed analysis and buy/sell recommendations to users.
- Notifies users instantly when a coin starts trending.
- Accessible via Telegram commands and inline buttons.

---

## Alert Agent: Market Intelligence, Decision Making, and Autonomy

### **Market Intelligence**
- Continuously monitors Zora and Base for trending coins, price spikes, volume surges, and new mints.
- Aggregates on-chain data (price, volume, holders, market cap) and off-chain data (social, news, sentiment).
- Uses the `@zoralabs/coins-sdk` and custom logic to build a real-time intelligence feed.

### **Decision Making**
- The agent's core logic is in `telegram-trading-bot/agent/index.ts`.
- Each coin is scored using a multi-factor model:
  - **Price Change**: 24h, 1h, and 5m momentum
  - **Volume**: Trading activity and liquidity
  - **Market Cap**: Growth potential vs. risk
  - **Holder Distribution**: Community spread and whale risk
  - **Social Presence**: Twitter, Telegram, website
  - **Risk Assessment**: Volatility, liquidity, and contract safety
- The agent generates a buy/sell/hold/alert decision for each coin, with confidence and risk level.
- Example (from code):
```ts
// agent/index.ts (simplified)
if (coin.priceChange24h > 50) buyAdvice = "STRONG_BUY";
else if (coin.priceChange24h > 20) buyAdvice = "BUY";
else if (coin.priceChange24h < -30) buyAdvice = "SELL";
// ...plus volume, cap, holders, social, risk
```

### **Autonomous Features**
- Runs on a schedule or on-demand (via Telegram commands or triggers).
- Sends proactive alerts to users when:
  - A coin starts trending
  - A buy/sell threshold is crossed
  - Market anomalies are detected
- Can operate fully autonomously or in response to user queries.
- Designed for extensibility: add new data sources, signals, or alert types easily.

---

## Agent Flow Structure
- **Startup:** On bot start, agent scans trending coins and sends analysis.
- **Manual Trigger:** Users can run `/trending` or `/quicktrending` for instant analysis.
- **Analysis:** Each coin is scored for price change, volume, market cap, holders, and social presence.
- **Buy Advice:** Generates STRONG_BUY, BUY, HOLD, SELL, or STRONG_SELL with confidence and risk level.
- **Alerts:** Sends top recommendations and summary to users.
